# Analysing-IMDB-reviews-using-GloVe-and-LSTM
Using the IMDB data found in Keras here a few algorithms built with Keras. The source code is from Francois Chollet's book Deep learning with Python. The aim is to predict whether a review is positive or negative just by analyzing the text.  Both self-created as well as pre-trained (GloVe) word embeddings are used. Finally there's a LSTM model and the accuracies of the different algorithms are compared. For the LSTM model I had to cut the data sets of 25.000 sequences by 80% to 5.000, since my laptop's CPU was not able to run the data crunching, making the model's not fully comparable.
